# Automatic-Attendance-Tracker

This is a capstone project done during my course.

Just "one" click and the classroom attendance is taken - with the help of this app.

We need to give a class photo as an input to this app. Select the subject and submit. An excel file created with the attendance.

For further reference this app will save the class photo with date as name inside the respective subject folder.

This app is built using flask.

Files folder --> You can find flask skeleton and code.

Setup folder --> You can download the setup and can use the app.

Work folder --> You can find ipynb files which shows on different models we worked on and their results.

You can even see the report or presentation for reference.
